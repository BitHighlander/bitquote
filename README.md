##BitQuote

An easy to embed bitcoin to fiat widget with data taken from http://www.bitcoinaverage.com/

To see it working go to my [github page](http://orweinberger.github.io/bitquote/)

```
options {
  "fiat": "USD", // The fiat we want to convert to
  "fiatSymbol": "$", // The fiat symbol
  "autoUpdate": true, // Set this to true if you would like to have the widget auto update every 60 seconds
  "href": "http://www.bitcoinaverage.com" // link to redirect to if widget is clicked on, if you don't want to use this functionality please remove this option completely
}
```
